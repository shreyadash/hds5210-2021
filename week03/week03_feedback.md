Part 1:  5/5

Part 2:  5/5

14.4 - Everything you've got there works great, but just one note on style.  Having the `if score > 10:` down at the bottom of your function separate diagnosis code checks makes it a little harder to follow.  It's better style to keep all of the code used to make that assignment decision together in one place.  In this case, probably down at the bottom.

Also, you could have reused your LACE function just by calling it: `lace_score = LACE(...)` rather than copying and pasting.  

No points off for either of these points, though.

Nice work!
