Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

I like the topic you chose.  I'm curiosu to see what conclusions you draw!

The first chart you included seems a bit hard to read because it includes an entry on the x-axis for every single age.  I see that you tried to plot this as a histogram, but I think some of your options are messing up what you're trying to accomplish.  Also, when plotting multiple series on the same histogram, it's helpful to use tansparency or line charts rather than bars.  It's not possible to see what's happening with red behind the blue.
